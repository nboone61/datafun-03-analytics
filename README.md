# datafun-03-analytics

This project demonstrates how to fetch and process various types of 
data (Excel, JSON, text, and CSV) using Python. 

The repository includes:

- Four example fetchers: Scripts to retrieve data from the web.
- Four example processors: Scripts to analyze and process the fetched data.

Start by running the examples to understand their functionality, and then build your own scripts to fetch and process data of your choice (using each of these example types).

## Project Requirements

- VS Code
- Git
- Python 

## Create and Run Your Data Fetchers
1. Find data files on the web for each type (CSV, Excel, JSON, and text).  
2. Create your own Python script to fetch each type of data and save it in a folder named **data**.
3. Name your scripts:
   1. yourname_get_csv.py
   2. yourname_get_excel.py
   3. yourname_get_json.py
   4. yourname_get_text.py
4. Implement your data-processing logic in small steps:
   - Fetch data for one file type.
   - Test, verify, and Git add-commit-push.
  
## Create and Run Your Data Processors
1. Determine a simple metric from each of your data files.  
2. Create your own Python script to read the data, process it, and save it in a folder named **data_processed**.
3. Name your scripts:
   1. yourname_process_csv.py
   2. yourname_process_excel.py
   3. yourname_process_json.py
   4. yourname_process_text.py
4. Work incrementally, using git add-commit-push after each bit of progress.
